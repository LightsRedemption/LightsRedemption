## My name is Giovanny Orlando Rosales. Welcome To My Glorious Universe. 👋


I am currently a first year Astronomy graduate student at New Mexico State University. I recieved a Bachelor's degree in Physics with a Specilzation in Astrophyscis from the University of California, Irivne. After a strange gap year trying to get in and auditioning for Julliard, I completed a Master's degree in Computational Physics at the California State University of Long Beach!
